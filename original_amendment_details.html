\n     and\n       ``(B) facing sudden and severe economic dislocations \n     because of structural economic changes, changing trade \n     patterns, certain Federal actions (including environmental \n     requirements that result in the removal of economic \n     activities from a locality), impacts from natural disasters, \n     and transitioning industries, including energy generation, \n     steel production, and mining;\n       ``(2) economic growth in the States, cities, and rural \n     areas of the United States is produced by expanding economic \n     opportunities, expanding free enterprise through trade, \n     promoting resilience in public infrastructure, creating \n     conditions for job creation, job retention, and business \n     development, and by capturing the opportunities to lead the \n     industries of the future, including advanced technologies, \n     clean energy production, and advanced manufacturing \n     technologies;\n       ``(3) the goal of Federal economic development programs is \n     to raise the standard of living for all citizens and increase \n     the wealth and overall rate of growth of the economy by \n     encouraging communities to develop a more competitive and \n     diversified economic base by--\n       ``(A) creating an environment that promotes economic \n     activity by improving and expanding modern public \n     infrastructure;\n       ``(B) promoting job creation, retention, and workforce \n     readiness through increased innovation, productivity, and \n     entrepreneurship;

COMPETITIVE LOCAL COMPENSATION PLAN.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the effectiveness and stability of United States \n     foreign missions are linked to the dedication and expertise \n     of locally employed staff; and\n       (2) ensuring competitive compensation packages benchmarked \n     against the local market is essential not only to retain \n     valuable talent but also to reflect a commitment to \n     employment practices abroad.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated $47,500,000 for fiscal year 2025 to \n     support implementation of a global baseline for prevailing \n     wage rate goal for Local Compensation Plan positions at the \n     75th percentile.\n\n     SEC. 9105.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The State Trade Expansion Program established under \n     section 22(l) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 649(l)) \n     (in this section referred to as ``STEP'') was created by \n     Congress in 2010 to grow the number of small business \n     concerns (as defined under section 3 of such Act (15 U.S.C. \n     632) and in this section referred to as a ``small business \n     concern'') that export, increase the value of goods exported \n     by the small business sector, and help businesses identify \n     new markets.\n       (2) Helping small firms in the United States begin to \n     export or build upon their existing export capacity generates \n     investment in local economies and spurs employment.\n       (3) Despite 95 percent of global consumers living outside \n     of the United States, less than 4 percent of small business \n     concerns in the United States export their products or \n     services.\n       (4) Many small business concerns in the United States that \n     could grow by exporting lack the dedicated staff, required \n     technical skills, and necessary budgetary resources for \n     international expansion.\n       (5) STEP provides vital assistance to small business \n     concerns, particularly to those that have never had the \n     opportunity to sell their products or services abroad.\n\n[[Page S4768]]\n\n       (6) According to data of the Bureau of the Census, there \n     were approximately 5,900,000 employer firms in the United \n     States as of 2021, of which more than 1,200,000, or \n     approximately 22 percent, were women-owned. However, \n     according to the data, of the 128,460 exporting small firms, \n     only 21,626, or 17 percent, were women-owned firms, meaning \n     that, of small firms, 5 times as many male-owned firms export \n     as women-owned firms. The data show that the overall \n     disparity in business ownership between men and women is even \n     greater among exporting businesses.\n       (7) According to research conducted by the Small Business \n     Administration, smaller firms tend to produce fewer outputs \n     and are less likely to export than larger firms. Data of the \n     Bureau of the Census show that women-owned firms employ 33 \n     percent fewer workers on average than male-owned firms and \n     are less likely to enjoy the benefits of international trade.\n       (8) Exporting is a highly effective way for businesses to \n     expand their markets and increase their productivity. As \n     States expand export-enhancing activities through STEP, \n     additional small firms will benefit from the higher demand \n     for their goods and services and increased profits associated \n     with international trade.\n       (9) During the first 10 years of operation, STEP enabled \n     more than 12,000 small business concerns to explore export \n     opportunities, helping them reach markets in 141 countries.\n       (10) Congress recognizes that STEP can be improved to \n     reduce the administrative burden for grantees, streamline \n     reporting and compliance requirements, give grantees more \n     flexibility, make grant awards more transparent and \n     consistent, and set more predictable application deadlines.\n       (11) Congress also recognizes that making awards under STEP \n     more consistent and transparent will simplify the program and \n     incentivize more States to participate so that small business \n     concerns are supported in all States.\n\n     SEC. 6003.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the United Nations Children's Fund \n     (UNICEF), there are approximately 240,000,000 children and \n     youth with disabilities in the world, including approximately \n     53,000,000 children under the age of 5.\n       (2) Millions of children, particularly children with \n     intellectual and other developmental disabilities, are placed \n     in large or small residential institutions and most of those \n     children are left to grow up without love, support, and \n     guidance of a family.\n       (3) The vast majority of children placed in residential \n     institutions have at least one living parent or have extended \n     family, many of whom would keep their children at home, if \n     they had the support and legal protections necessary to do \n     so.\n       (4) Leading child protection organizations have documented \n     that children and adolescents raised without families in \n     residential institutions face high risk of violence, \n     trafficking for forced labor or sex, forced abortion or \n     sterilization, and criminal detention.\n       (5) According to the Department of State, persons with \n     disabilities face a heightened risk of human trafficking, \n     including children in residential institutions, who may be \n     targeted by traffickers seeking to coerce them to leave or \n     find ways to exploit them.\n       (6) According to the Department of State, residential \n     institutions have been complicit or directly involved in \n     human trafficking, even extending to the practice of \n     recruiting children for residential institutions for such \n     purposes.\n       (7) Children with disabilities placed in residential \n     institutions remain vulnerable to human trafficking even \n     after leaving, in part due to the physical and psychological \n     damage such children have suffered, social isolation, and \n     inadequate schooling, and traffickers target individuals who \n     leave or age out of institutions.\n\n     SEC. 1299E. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) stigma and discrimination against children with \n     disabilities, particularly intellectual and other \n     developmental disabilities, and lack of support for community \n     inclusion have left people with disabilities and their \n     families economically and socially marginalized;\n       (2) organizations of persons with disabilities and family \n     members of persons with disabilities are often too small to \n     apply for or obtain funds from domestic or international \n     sources or ineligible to receive funds from such sources;\n       (3) as a result of the factors described in paragraphs (1) \n     and (2), key stakeholders have often been left out of public \n     policymaking on matters that affect children with \n     disabilities; and\n       (4) financial support, technical assistance, and active \n     engagement of persons with disabilities and their families is \n     needed to ensure the development of effective policies that \n     protect families, ensure the full inclusion in society of \n     children with disabilities, and promote the ability of \n     persons with disabilities to live in the community with \n     choices equal to others.\n\n     SEC. 1299F.

Severability.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS OF GENERAL CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.\n\n       Congress finds that the Constitution of the United States \n     grants explicit and broad authority to protect the right to \n     vote, to regulate elections for Federal office, to prevent \n     and remedy discrimination in voting, and to defend the \n     Nation's democratic process. Congress enacts the Freedom to \n     Vote Act pursuant to this broad authority, including but not \n     limited to the following:\n       (1) Congress finds that it has broad authority to regulate \n     the time, place, and manner of congressional elections under \n     the Elections Clause of the Constitution, article I, section \n     4, clause 1. The Supreme Court has affirmed that the \n     ``substantive scope'' of the Elections Clause is ``broad''; \n     that ``Times, Places, and Manner'' are ``comprehensive words \n     which embrace authority to provide for a complete code for \n     congressional elections''; and ``[t]he power of Congress over \n     the Times, Places and Manner of congressional elections is \n     paramount, and may be exercised at any time, and to any \n     extent which it deems expedient; and so far as it is \n     exercised, and no farther, the regulations effected supersede \n     those of the State which are inconsistent therewith''. \n     Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, 570 U.S. 1, 8-9 \n     (2013) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n     Indeed, ``Congress has plenary and paramount jurisdiction \n     over the whole subject'' of congressional elections, Ex parte \n     Siebold, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 371, 388 (1879), and this power \n     ``may be exercised as and when Congress sees fit'', and ``so \n     far as it extends and conflicts with the regulations of the \n     State, necessarily supersedes them''. Id. at 384. Among other \n     things, Congress finds that the Elections Clause was intended \n     to ``vindicate the people's right to equality of \n     representation in the House''. Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. \n     1, 16 (1964), and to address partisan gerrymandering, Rucho \n     v. Common Cause, 139 S. Ct. 2484 (2019).\n       (2) Congress also finds that it has both the authority and \n     responsibility, as the legislative body for the United \n     States, to fulfill the promise of article IV, section 4, of \n     the Constitution, which states: ``The United States shall \n     guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of \n     Government[.]''. Congress finds that its authority and \n     responsibility to enforce the Guarantee Clause is clear given \n     that Federal courts have not enforced this clause because \n     they understood that its enforcement is committed to Congress \n     by the Constitution.\n       (3)(A) Congress also finds that it has broad authority \n     pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to \n     legislate to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment, including its protections of the right to vote and \n     the democratic process.\n       (B) Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the \n     fundamental right to vote, which is ``of the most fundamental \n     significance under our constitutional structure''. Ill. Bd. \n     of Election v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 184 \n     (1979); see United States v.  Classic, 313 U.S. 299 (1941) \n     (``Obviously included within the right to choose, secured by \n     the Constitution, is the right of qualified voters within a \n     State to cast their ballots and have them counted . . .''). \n     As the Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed, the right to \n     vote is ``preservative of all rights'', Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n     118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886). Section 2 of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment also protects the right to vote, granting Congress \n     additional authority to reduce a State's representation in \n     Congress when the right to vote is abridged or denied.\n       (C) As a result, Congress finds that it has the authority \n     pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to protect \n     the right to vote. Congress also finds that States and \n     localities have eroded access to the right to vote through \n     restrictions on the right to vote including excessively \n     onerous voter identification requirements, burdensome voter \n     registration procedures, voter purges, limited and unequal \n     access to voting by mail, polling place closures, unequal \n     distribution of election resources, and other impediments.\n       (D) Congress also finds that ``the right of suffrage can be \n     denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a \n     citizen's vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting \n     the free exercise of the franchise''. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 \n     U.S. 533, 555 (1964). Congress finds that the right of \n     suffrage has been so diluted and debased by means of \n     gerrymandering of districts. Congress finds that it has \n     authority pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment \n     to remedy this debasement.\n       (4)(A) Congress also finds that it has authority to \n     legislate to eliminate racial discrimination in voting and \n     the democratic process pursuant to both section 5 of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment, which grants equal protection of the \n     laws, and section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment, which \n     explicitly bars denial or abridgment of the right to vote on \n     account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\n       (B) Congress finds that racial discrimination in access to \n     voting and the political process persists. Voting \n     restrictions, redistricting, and other electoral practices \n     and processes continue to disproportionately impact \n     communities of color in the United States and do so as a \n     result of both intentional racial discrimination, structural \n     racism, and the ongoing structural socioeconomic effects of \n     historical racial discrimination.\n       (C) Recent elections and studies have shown that minority \n     communities wait longer in lines to vote, are more likely to \n     have their mail ballots rejected, continue to face \n     intimidation at the polls, are more likely to be \n     disenfranchised by voter purges, and are disproportionately \n     burdened by excessively onerous voter identification and \n     other voter restrictions. Research shows that communities of \n     color are more likely to face nearly every barrier to voting \n     than their white counterparts.\n       (D) Congress finds that racial disparities in \n     disenfranchisement due to past felony convictions is \n     particularly stark. In 2022, according to the Sentencing \n     Project, an estimated 4,600,000 Americans could not vote due \n     to a felony conviction. One in 19 African Americans of voting \n     age is disenfranchised, a rate 3.5 times greater than that of \n     non-African Americans. In eight States--Alabama, Arizona, \n     Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Dakota, Tennessee, and \n     Virginia--more than one in ten African Americans is \n     disenfranchised, nearly twice the national average for \n     African Americans. Congress finds that felony \n     disenfranchisement was one of the tools of intentional racial \n     discrimination during the Jim Crow era. Congress further \n     finds that current racial disparities in felony \n     disenfranchisement are linked to this history of voter \n     suppression, structural racism in the criminal justice \n     system, and ongoing effects of historical discrimination.\n       (5)(A) Congress finds that it further has the power to \n     protect the right to vote from denial or abridgment on \n     account of sex, age, or ability to pay a poll tax or other \n     tax pursuant to the Nineteenth, Twenty-Fourth, and Twenty-\n     Sixth Amendments.\n       (B) Congress finds that electoral practices including \n     voting rights restoration conditions for people with \n     convictions and other restrictions to the franchise burden \n     voters on account of their ability to pay.\n       (C) Congress further finds that electoral practices \n     including voting restrictions related to college campuses, \n     age restrictions on mail voting, and similar practices burden \n     the right to vote on account of age.\n\n     SEC. 4. STANDARDS FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       (a) In General.--For any action brought for declaratory or \n     injunctive relief to challenge, whether facially or as-\n     applied, the constitutionality or lawfulness of any provision \n     of this division or any amendment made by this division or \n     any rule or regulation promulgated under this division, the \n     following rules shall apply:\n       (1) The action shall be filed in the United States District \n     Court for the District of Columbia and an appeal from the \n     decision of the district court may be taken to the Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. These courts, \n     and the Supreme Court of the United States on a writ of \n     certiorari (if such writ is issued), shall have exclusive \n     jurisdiction to hear such actions.\n       (2) The party filing the action shall concurrently deliver \n     a copy the complaint to the Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate.\n       (3) It shall be the duty of the United States District \n     Court for the District of Columbia and the Court of Appeals \n     for the District of Columbia Circuit to advance on the docket \n     and to expedite to the greatest possible extent the \n     disposition of the action and appeal.\n       (b) Clarifying Scope of Jurisdiction.--If an action at the \n     time of its commencement is not subject to subsection (a), \n     but an amendment, counterclaim, cross-claim, affirmative \n     defense, or any other pleading or motion is filed \n     challenging, whether facially or as-applied, the \n     constitutionality or lawfulness of this division or any \n     amendment made by this division or any rule or regulation \n     promulgated under this division, the district court shall \n     transfer the action to the District Court for the District of \n     Columbia, and the action shall thereafter be conducted \n     pursuant to subsection (a).\n       (c) Intervention by Members of Congress.--In any action \n     described in subsection (a), any Member of the House of \n     Representatives (including a Delegate or Resident \n     Commissioner to the Congress) or Senate shall have the right \n     to intervene either in support of or opposition to the \n     position of a party to the case regarding the \n     constitutionality of the provision. To avoid duplication of \n     efforts and reduce the burdens placed on the parties to the \n     action, the court in any such action may make such orders as \n     it considers necessary, including orders to require \n     interveners taking similar positions to file joint papers or \n     to be represented by a single attorney at oral argument.\n\n     SEC. 5.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Democracy Restoration \n     Act of 2024''.\n\n     SEC. 1702. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The right to vote is the most basic constitutive act of \n     citizenship. Regaining the right to vote reintegrates \n     individuals with criminal convictions into free society, \n     helping to enhance public safety.\n       (2) Article I, section 4, of the Constitution grants \n     Congress ultimate supervisory power over Federal elections, \n     an authority which has repeatedly been upheld by the United \n     States Supreme Court.\n       (3) Basic constitutional principles of fairness and equal \n     protection require an equal opportunity for citizens of the \n     United States to vote in Federal elections. The right to vote \n     may not be abridged or denied by the United States or by any \n     State on account of race, color, gender, or previous \n     condition of servitude. The 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and \n     26th Amendments to the Constitution empower Congress to enact \n     measures to protect the right to vote in Federal elections. \n     The 8th Amendment to the Constitution provides for no \n     excessive bail to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, \n     nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\n       (4) There are 3 areas in which discrepancies in State laws \n     regarding criminal convictions lead to unfairness in Federal \n     elections--\n       (A) the lack of a uniform standard for voting in Federal \n     elections leads to an unfair disparity and unequal \n     participation in Federal elections based solely on where a \n     person lives;\n       (B) laws governing the restoration of voting rights after a \n     criminal conviction vary throughout the country and persons \n     in some States can easily regain their voting rights while in \n     other States persons effectively lose their right to vote \n     permanently; and\n       (C) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact \n     racial and ethnic minorities.\n       (5) State disenfranchisement laws vary widely. Two States \n     (Maine and Vermont) and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico do \n     not disenfranchise individuals with criminal convictions at \n     all. In 2020, the District of Columbia re-enfranchised its \n     citizens who are under the supervision of the Federal Bureau \n     of Prisons. Twenty-five States disenfranchise certain \n     individuals on felony probation or parole. During 2023, \n     lawmakers in Minnesota and New Mexico expanded voting rights \n     to citizens on felony probation and parole. In 11 States, a \n     conviction for certain offenses can result in lifetime \n     disenfranchisement.\n       (6) Several States deny the right to vote to individuals \n     convicted of certain misdemeanors.\n       (7) In 2022, over 4,600,000 citizens of the United States, \n     or about 1 in 50 adults in the United States, could not vote \n     as a result of a felony conviction. Of the 4,600,000 citizens \n     barred from voting then, only 23 percent were in prison or \n     jail. By contrast, 75 percent of persons disenfranchised then \n     resided in their communities while on probation or parole or \n     after having completed their sentences. Approximately \n     2,200,000 citizens who had completed their sentences were \n     disenfranchised due to restrictive State laws. Over 930,000 \n     Floridians who completed their sentence remain \n     disenfranchised because of a pay-to-vote requirement that was \n     enacted by Florida lawmakers in 2019 to undermine the impact \n     of a 2018 ballot initiative that eliminated the lifetime ban \n     for persons with certain felony convictions. In 3 States--\n     Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee--more than 8 percent of \n     the total population is disenfranchised.\n       (8) In those States that disenfranchise individuals post-\n     sentence, the right to vote can be regained in theory, but in \n     practice this possibility is often granted in a non-uniform \n     and potentially discriminatory manner. Disenfranchised \n     individuals sometimes must either obtain a pardon or an order \n     from the Governor or an action by the parole or pardon board, \n     depending on the offense and State. Financial restrictions \n     may also inhibit individuals who have completed their \n     sentences from re-enfranchisement. Individuals convicted of a \n     Federal offense often have additional barriers to regaining \n     voting rights.\n       (9) Many felony disenfranchisement laws today derive \n     directly from post-Civil War efforts to stifle the Fourteenth \n     and Fifteenth Amendments. Between 1865 and 1880, at least 14 \n     States--Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, \n     Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North \n     Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas--enacted or \n     expanded their felony disenfranchisement laws. One of the \n     primary goals of these laws was to prevent African Americans \n     from voting. Of the States that enacted or expanded their \n     felony disenfranchisement laws during this post-Civil War \n     period, at least 11 continue to preclude persons on felony \n     probation or parole from voting.\n       (10) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately \n     impact racial and ethnic minorities. In recent years, African \n     Americans have been imprisoned at over 5 times the rate of \n     Whites. More than 6 percent of the voting-age African-\n     American population, or 1,800,000 African Americans, are \n     disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. In 9 States--\n     Alabama (16 percent), Arizona\n\n[[Page S4448]]\n\n     (13 percent), Florida (15 percent), Kentucky (15 percent), \n     Mississippi (16 percent), South Dakota (14 percent), \n     Tennessee (21 percent), Virginia (16 percent), and Wyoming \n     (36 percent)--more than 1 in 8 African Americans are unable \n     to vote because of a felony conviction, twice the national \n     average for African Americans.\n       (11) Latino citizens are also disproportionately \n     disenfranchised based upon their disproportionate \n     representation in the criminal justice system. Although data \n     on ethnicity in correctional populations are unevenly \n     reported and undercounted in some States, a conservative \n     estimate is that at least 506,000 Latino Americans or 1.7 \n     percent of the voting-age population are disenfranchised. In \n     31 States Latinos are disenfranchised at a higher rate than \n     the general population. In Arizona and Tennessee over 6 \n     percent of Latino voters are disenfranchised due to a felony \n     conviction.\n       (12) Women have been significantly impacted by mass \n     incarceration since the early 1980s. Approximately 1,000,000 \n     women were disenfranchised in 2022, comprising over 20 \n     percent of the total disenfranchised population.\n       (13) Disenfranchising citizens who have been convicted of a \n     criminal offense and who are living and working in the \n     community serves no compelling State interest and hinders \n     their rehabilitation and reintegration into society. Models \n     of successful re-entry for persons convicted of a crime \n     emphasize the importance of community ties, feeling vested \n     and integrated, and prosocial attitudes. Individuals with \n     criminal convictions who succeed in avoiding recidivism are \n     typically more likely to see themselves as law-abiding \n     members of the community. Restoration of voting rights builds \n     those qualities and facilitates reintegration into the \n     community. That is why allowing citizens with criminal \n     convictions who are living in a community to vote is \n     correlated with a lower likelihood of recidivism. Restoration \n     of voting rights thus reduces violence and protects public \n     safety.\n       (14) State disenfranchisement laws can suppress electoral \n     participation among eligible voters by discouraging voting \n     among family and community members of disenfranchised \n     persons. Future electoral participation by the children of \n     disenfranchised parents may be impacted as well.\n       (15) The United States is one of the only Western \n     democracies that permits the permanent denial of voting \n     rights for individuals with felony convictions.\n       (16) The Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and \n     unusual punishments ``guarantees individuals the right not to \n     be subjected to excessive sanctions.'' (Roper v. Simmons, 543 \n     U.S. 551, 560 (2005)). That right stems from the basic \n     precept of justice ``that punishment for crime should be \n     graduated and proportioned to [the] offense.'' Id. (quoting \n     Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 367 (1910)). As the \n     Supreme Court has long recognized, ``[t]he concept of \n     proportionality is central to the Eighth Amendment.'' (Graham \n     v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 59 (2010)). Many State \n     disenfranchisement laws are grossly disproportional to the \n     offenses that lead to disenfranchisement and thus violate the \n     bar on cruel and unusual punishments. For example, a number \n     of States mandate lifetime disenfranchisement for a single \n     felony conviction or just two felony convictions, even where \n     the convictions were for non-violent offenses. In numerous \n     other States, disenfranchisement can last years or even \n     decades while individuals remain on probation or parole, \n     often only because a person cannot pay their legal financial \n     obligations. These kinds of extreme voting bans run afoul of \n     the Eighth Amendment.\n       (17) The Twenty-Fourth Amendment provides that the right to \n     vote ``shall not be denied or abridged by the United States \n     or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or \n     other tax.'' Section 2 of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment gives \n     Congress the power to enforce this article by appropriate \n     legislation. Court fines and fees that individuals must pay \n     to have their voting rights restored constitute an ``other \n     tax'' for purposes of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. At least \n     five States explicitly require the payment of fines and fees \n     before individuals with felony convictions can have their \n     voting rights restored. More than 20 other States effectively \n     tie the right to vote to the payment of fines and fees, by \n     requiring that individuals complete their probation or parole \n     before their rights are restored. In these States, the non-\n     payment of fines and fees is a basis on which probation or \n     parole can be extended. Moreover, these States sometimes do \n     not record the basis on which an individual's probation or \n     parole was extended, making it impossible to determine from \n     the State's records whether non-payment of fines and fees is \n     the reason that an individual remains on probation or parole. \n     For these reasons, the only way to ensure that States do not \n     deny the right to vote based solely on non-payment of fines \n     and fees is to prevent States from conditioning voting rights \n     on the completion of probation or parole.\n\n     SEC. 1703. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS.\n\n       The right of an individual who is a citizen of the United \n     States to vote in any election for Federal office shall not \n     be denied or abridged because that individual has been \n     convicted of a criminal offense unless such individual is \n     serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution or \n     facility at the time of the election.\n\n     SEC. 1704.

As \n     made clear at the Constitutional Convention and the State \n     ratification debates that followed, this grant of \n     congressional authority was meant to ``insure free and fair \n     elections,'' promote the uniform administration of Federal \n     elections, and ``preserve and restore to the people their \n     equal and sacred rights of election.''.\n       (3) In the founding debates on the Elections Clause, many \n     delegates also argued that a broad grant of authority to \n     Congress over Federal elections was necessary to check any \n     ``abuses that might be made of the discretionary power'' to \n     regulate the time, place, and manner of elections granted the\n\n[[Page S4452]]\n\n     States, including attempts at partisan entrenchment, \n     malapportionment, and the exclusion of political minorities. \n     As the Supreme Court has recognized, the Elections Clause \n     empowers Congress to ``protect the elections on which its \n     existence depends,'' Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 658 \n     (1884), and ``protect the citizen in the exercise of rights \n     conferred by the Constitution of the United States essential \n     to the healthy organization of the government itself,'' id. \n     at 666.\n       (4) The Elections Clause grants Congress ``plenary and \n     paramount jurisdiction over the whole subject'' of Federal \n     elections, Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 388 (1879), \n     allowing Congress to implement ``a complete code for \n     congressional elections.'' Smiley v.  Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 366 \n     (1932). The Elections Clause, unlike, for example, the \n     Commerce Clause, has been found to grant Congress the \n     authority to compel States to alter their regulations as to \n     Federal elections, id. at 366-67, even if these alterations \n     would impose additional costs on the States to execute or \n     enforce. Association of Community Organizations for Reform \n     Now v. Miller, 129 F.3d 833 (6th Cir. 1997).\n       (5) The phrase ``manner of holding elections'' in the \n     Elections Clause has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to \n     authorize Congress to regulate all aspects of the Federal \n     election process, including ``notices, registration, \n     supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of \n     fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of \n     inspectors and canvassers, and the making and publication of \n     election returns.'' Smiley v.  Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 366 \n     (1932).\n       (6) The Supreme Court has recognized the broad \n     ``substantive scope'' of the Elections Clause and upheld \n     Federal laws promulgated thereunder regulating redistricting, \n     voter registration, campaign finance, primary elections, \n     recounts, party affiliation rules, and balloting.\n       (7) The authority of Congress under the Elections Clause \n     also entails the power to ensure enforcement of its laws \n     regulating Federal elections. ``[I]f Congress has the power \n     to make regulations, it must have the power to enforce \n     them.'' Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 387 (1879). The \n     Supreme Court has noted that there can be no question that \n     Congress may impose additional penalties for offenses \n     committed by State officers in connection with Federal \n     elections even if they differ from the penalties prescribed \n     by State law for the same acts. Id. at 387-88.\n       (8) The fair and impartial administration of Federal \n     elections by State and local officials is central to ``the \n     successful working of this government,'' Ex parte Yarbrough, \n     110 U.S. 651, 666 (1884), and to ``protect the act of voting \n     . . . and the election itself from corruption or fraud,'' id. \n     at 661-62.\n       (9) The Elections Clause thus grants Congress the authority \n     to ensure that the administration of Federal elections is \n     free of political bias or discrimination and that election \n     officials are insulated from political influence or other \n     forms of coercion in discharging their duties in connection \n     with Federal elections.\n       (10) In some States, oversight of local election \n     administrators has been allocated to State Election Boards, \n     or special commissions formed by those boards, that are \n     appointed by the prevailing political party in a State, as \n     opposed to nonpartisan or elected office holders.\n       (11) In certain newly enacted State policies, these \n     appointed statewide election administrators have been granted \n     wide latitude to suspend or remove local election \n     administrators in cases where the statewide election \n     administrators identify whatever the State deems to be a \n     violation. There is no requirement that there be a finding of \n     intent by the local election administrator to commit the \n     violation.\n       (12) Local election administrators across the country can \n     be suspended or removed according to different standards, \n     potentially exposing them to different political pressures or \n     biases that could result in uneven administration of Federal \n     elections.\n       (13) The Elections Clause grants Congress the ultimate \n     authority to ensure that oversight of State and local \n     election administrators is fair and impartial in order to \n     ensure equitable and uniform administration of Federal \n     elections.\n       (b) Restriction.--\n       (1) Standard for removal of a local election \n     administrator.--A statewide election administrator may only \n     suspend, remove, or relieve the duties of a local election \n     administrator in the State with respect to the administration \n     of an election for Federal office for inefficiency, neglect \n     of duty, or malfeasance in office.\n       (2) Private right of action.--\n       (A) In general.--Any local election administrator \n     suspended, removed, or otherwise relieved of duties in \n     violation of paragraph (1) with respect to the administration \n     of an election for Federal office or against whom any \n     proceeding for suspension, removal, or relief from duty in \n     violation of paragraph (1) with respect to the administration \n     of an election for Federal office may be pending, may bring \n     an action in an appropriate district court of the United \n     States for declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to \n     the violation. Any such action shall name as the defendant \n     the statewide election administrator responsible for the \n     adverse action. The district court shall, to the extent \n     practicable, expedite any such proceeding.\n       (B) Statute of limitations.--Any action brought under this \n     subsection must be commenced not later than one year after \n     the date of the suspension, removal, relief from duties, or \n     commencement of the proceeding to remove, suspend, or relieve \n     the duties of a local election administrator with respect to \n     the administration of an election for Federal office.\n       (3) Attorney's fees.--In any action or proceeding under \n     this subsection, the court may allow a prevailing plaintiff, \n     other than the United States, reasonable attorney's fees as \n     part of the costs, and may include expert fees as part of the \n     attorney's fee. The term ``prevailing plaintiff'' means a \n     plaintiff that substantially prevails pursuant to a judicial \n     or administrative judgment or order, or an enforceable \n     written agreement.\n       (4) Removal of state proceedings to federal court.--A local \n     election administrator who is subject to an administrative or \n     judicial proceeding for suspension, removal, or relief from \n     duty by a statewide election administrator with respect to \n     the administration of an election for Federal office may \n     remove the proceeding to an appropriate district court of the \n     United States. Any order remanding a case to the State court \n     or agency from which it was removed under this subsection \n     shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.\n       (5) Right of united states to intervene.--\n       (A) Notice to attorney general.--Whenever any \n     administrative or judicial proceeding is brought to suspend, \n     remove, or relieve the duties of any local election \n     administrator by a statewide election administrator with \n     respect to the administration of an election for Federal \n     office, the statewide election administrator who initiated \n     such proceeding shall deliver a copy of the pleadings \n     instituting the proceeding to the Assistant Attorney General \n     for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. \n     The local election administrator against whom such proceeding \n     is brought may also deliver such pleadings to the Assistant \n     Attorney General.\n       (B) Right to intervene.--The United States may intervene in \n     any administrative or judicial proceeding brought to suspend, \n     remove, or relieve the duties of any local election \n     administrator by a statewide election administrator with \n     respect to the administration of an election for Federal \n     office and in any action initiated pursuant to paragraph (2) \n     or in any removal pursuant to paragraph (4).\n       (6) Review.--In reviewing any action brought under this \n     section, a court of the United States shall not afford any \n     deference to any State official, administrator, or tribunal \n     that initiated, approved, adjudicated, or reviewed any \n     administrative or judicial proceeding to suspend, remove, or \n     otherwise relieve the duties of a local election \n     administrator.\n       (c) Reports to the Department of Justice.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the \n     suspension, removal, or relief of the duties of a local \n     election administrator by a statewide election administrator, \n     the Statewide election administrator shall submit to the \n     Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Divisions of \n     the Department of Justice a report that includes the \n     following information:\n       (A) A statement that a local election administrator was \n     suspended, removed, or relieved of their duties.\n       (B) Information on whether the local election administrator \n     was determined to be inefficient or to have engaged in \n     neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.\n       (C) A description of the effect that the suspension, \n     removal, or relief of the duties of the local election \n     administrator will have on--\n       (i) the administration of elections and voters in the \n     election jurisdictions for which the local election official \n     provided such duties; and\n       (ii) the administration of elections and voters in the \n     State at large.\n       (D) Demographic information about the local election \n     official suspended, removed, or relieved and the \n     jurisdictions for which such election official was providing \n     the duties suspended, removed, or relieved.\n       (E) Such other information as requested by the Assistant \n     Attorney General for the purposes of determining--\n       (i) whether such suspension, removal, or relief of duties \n     was based on unlawful discrimination; and\n       (ii) whether such suspension, removal, or relief of duties \n     was due to inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in \n     office.\n       (2) Expedited reporting for actions within 30 days of an \n     election.--\n       (A) In general.--If a suspension, removal, or relief of \n     duties of a local administrator described in paragraph (1) \n     occurs during the period described in subparagraph (B), the \n     report required under paragraph (1) shall be submitted not \n     later than 48 hours after such suspension, removal, or relief \n     of duties.\n       (B) Period described.--The period described in this \n     subparagraph is any period which begins 60 days before the \n     date of an election for Federal office and which ends 60 days \n     after such election.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section, the following \n     definitions apply:\n       (1) Election.--The term ``election'' has the meaning given \n     the term in section 301(1) of the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 30101(1)).\n       (2) Federal office.--The term ``Federal office'' has the \n     meaning given the term in section 301(3) of the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 30101(3)).\n\n[[Page S4453]]\n\n       (3) Local election administrator.--The term ``local \n     election administrator'' means, with respect to a local \n     jurisdiction in a State, the individual or entity responsible \n     for the administration of elections for Federal office in the \n     local jurisdiction.\n       (4) Statewide election administrator.--The term ``statewide \n     election administrator'' means, with respect to a State--\n       (A) the individual or entity, including a State elections \n     board, responsible for the administration of elections for \n     Federal office in the State on a statewide basis;

FINDINGS.\n\n       In addition to providing for the statutory rights described \n     in part 1, including judicial review under section 3403, \n     Congress makes the following findings regarding enforcement \n     of constitutional provisions protecting the right to vote:\n       (1) It is a priority of Congress to ensure that pending and \n     future disputes arising under the Fifteenth Amendment or any \n     other constitutional provisions protecting the right to vote \n     may be heard in Federal court.\n       (2) The Fifth Circuit has misconstrued section 1344 of \n     title 28, United States Code, to deprive Federal courts of \n     subject matter jurisdiction in certain classes of cases that \n     implicate voters' constitutional rights, see, e.g., Keyes v.  \n     Gunn, 890 F.3d 232 (5th Cir. 2018), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. \n     434 (2018); Johnson v.  Stevenson, 170 F.2d 108 (5th Cir. \n     1948).\n       (3) Section 1344 of such title is also superfluous in light \n     of other broad grants of Federal jurisdiction. See, e.g., \n     section 1331, section 1343(a)(3), and section 1343(a)(4) of \n     title 28, United States Code.\n       (4) Congress therefore finds that a repeal of section 1344 \n     is appropriate and that such repeal will ensure that Federal \n     courts nationwide are empowered to enforce voters' \n     constitutional rights in Federal elections and State \n     legislative elections.\n\n     SEC. 3412.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This part and the amendments made by this part shall apply \n     to actions brought on or after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act and to actions brought before the date of enactment \n     of this Act which are pending as of such date.\n\n            Subtitle F--Poll Worker Recruitment and Training\n\n     SEC. 3501.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the \n     ``Voters' Access to Water Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) States have a legitimate interest in prohibiting \n     electioneering at or near polling places, and each State has \n     some form of restriction on political activities near polling \n     places when voting is taking place.\n       (2) In recent elections, voters have waited in unacceptably \n     long lines to cast their ballot. During the 2018 midterm \n     election, more than 3,000,000 voters were made to wait longer \n     than the acceptable threshold for wait times set by the \n     Presidential Commission on Election Administration, including \n     many well-documented cases where voters were made to wait for \n     several hours. A disproportionate number of those who had to \n     wait long periods were Black or Latino voters, who were more \n     likely than White voters to wait in the longest lines on \n     Election Day.\n       (3) Allowing volunteers to donate food and water to all \n     people waiting in line at a polling place, regardless of the \n     voters' political preference and without engaging in \n     electioneering activities or partisan advocacy, helps ensure \n     Americans who face long lines at their polling place can \n     still exercise their Constitutional right to vote, without \n     risk of dehydration, inadequate food, discomfort, and risks \n     to health.\n\n     SEC. 3702.

FINDINGS RELATING TO ILLICIT MONEY UNDERMINING OUR \n                   DEMOCRACY.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Criminals, terrorists, and corrupt government officials \n     frequently abuse anonymously held Limited Liability Companies \n     (LLCs), also known as ``shell companies,'' to hide, move, and \n     launder the dirty money derived from illicit activities such \n     as trafficking, bribery, exploitation, and embezzlement. \n     Ownership and control of the finances that run through shell \n     companies are obscured to regulators and law enforcement \n     because little information is required and collected when \n     establishing these entities.\n       (2) The public release of the ``Panama Papers'' in 2016 and \n     the ``Paradise Papers'' in 2017 revealed that these shell \n     companies often purchase and sell United States real estate. \n     United States anti-money laundering laws do not apply to cash \n     transactions involving real estate effectively concealing the \n     beneficiaries and transactions from regulators and law \n     enforcement.\n       (3) Since the Supreme Court's decisions in Citizens United \n     v.  Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), \n     billions of dollars have flowed into super PACs through LLCs \n     whose funders are anonymous or intentionally obscured. \n     Criminal investigations have uncovered LLCs that were used to \n     hide illegal campaign contributions from foreign criminal \n     fugitives, to advance international influence-buying schemes, \n     and to conceal contributions from donors who were already \n     under investigation for bribery and racketeering.

BAN ON MID-DECADE REDISTRICTING.\n\n       A State that has been redistricted in accordance with this \n     title may not be redistricted again until after the next \n     apportionment of Representatives under section 22(a) of the \n     Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the fifteenth and \n     subsequent decennial censuses and to provide for an \n     apportionment of Representatives in Congress'', approved June \n     18, 1929 (2 U.S.C. 2a), unless a court requires the State to \n     conduct such subsequent redistricting to comply with the \n     Constitution of the United States, the Voting Rights Act of \n     1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), the terms or conditions of \n     this title, or applicable State law.\n\n     SEC. 5003. CRITERIA FOR REDISTRICTING.\n\n       (a) Requiring Plans to Meet Criteria.--A State may not use \n     a congressional redistricting plan enacted following the \n     notice of apportionment transmitted to the President on April \n     26, 2021, or any subsequent notice of apportionment, if such \n     plan is not in compliance with this section, without regard \n     to whether or not the plan was enacted by the State before, \n     on, or after the effective date of this title.\n       (b) Ranked Criteria.--Under the redistricting plan of a \n     State, there shall be established single-member congressional \n     districts using the following criteria as set forth in the \n     following order of priority:\n       (1) Districts shall comply with the United States \n     Constitution, including the requirement that they \n     substantially equalize total population, without regard to \n     age, citizenship status, or immigration status.\n       (2) Districts shall comply with the Voting Rights Act of \n     1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), including by creating any \n     districts where, if based upon the totality of the \n     circumstances, 2 or more politically cohesive groups \n     protected by such Act are able to elect representatives of \n     choice in coalition with one another, and all applicable \n     Federal laws.\n       (3)(A) Districts shall be drawn, to the extent that the \n     totality of the circumstances warrant, to ensure the \n     practical ability of a group protected under the Voting \n     Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.) to participate \n     in the political process and to nominate candidates and to \n     elect representatives of choice is not diluted or diminished, \n     regardless of whether or not such protected group constitutes \n     a majority of a district's population, voting age population, \n     or citizen voting age population.\n       (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the assessment of \n     whether a protected group has the practical ability to \n     nominate candidates and to elect representatives of choice \n     shall require the consideration of the following factors:\n       (i) Whether the group is politically cohesive.\n       (ii) Whether there is racially polarized voting in the \n     relevant geographic region.\n       (iii) If there is racially polarized voting in the relevant \n     geographic region, whether the preferred candidates of the \n     group nevertheless receive a sufficient amount of consistent \n     crossover support from other voters such that the group is a \n     functional majority with the ability to both nominate \n     candidates and elect representatives of choice.\n       (4)(A) Districts shall be drawn to represent communities of \n     interest and neighborhoods to the extent practicable after \n     compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (1) through \n     (3). A community of interest is defined as an area for which \n     the record before the entity responsible for developing and \n     adopting the redistricting plan demonstrates the existence of \n     broadly shared interests and representational needs, \n     including shared interests and representational needs rooted \n     in common ethnic, racial, economic, Indian, social, cultural, \n     geographic, or historic identities, or arising from similar \n     socioeconomic conditions. The term communities of interest \n     may, if the record warrants, include political subdivisions \n     such as counties, municipalities, Indian lands, or school \n     districts, but shall not include common relationships with \n     political parties or political candidates.\n       (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), in considering the \n     needs of multiple, overlapping communities of interest, the \n     entity responsible for developing and adopting the \n     redistricting plan shall give greater weight to those \n     communities of interest whose representational needs would \n     most benefit from the community's inclusion in a single \n     congressional district.\n       (c) No Favoring or Disfavoring of Political Parties.--\n       (1) Prohibition.--A State may not use a redistricting plan \n     to conduct an election if the plan's congressional districts, \n     when considered cumulatively on a statewide basis, have been \n     drawn with the intent or have the effect of materially \n     favoring or disfavoring any political party.\n       (2) Determination of effect.--The determination of whether \n     a redistricting plan has the effect of materially favoring or \n     disfavoring a political party shall be based on an evaluation \n     of the totality of circumstances which, at a minimum, shall \n     involve consideration of each of the following factors:\n       (A) Computer modeling based on relevant statewide general \n     elections for Federal office held over the 8 years preceding \n     the adoption of the redistricting plan setting forth the \n     probable electoral outcomes for the plan under a range of \n     reasonably foreseeable conditions.\n       (B) An analysis of whether the redistricting plan is \n     statistically likely to result in partisan advantage or \n     disadvantage on a statewide basis, the degree of any such \n     advantage or disadvantage, and whether such advantage or \n     disadvantage is likely to be\n\n[[Page S4466]]\n\n     present under a range of reasonably foreseeable electoral \n     conditions.\n       (C) A comparison of the modeled electoral outcomes for the \n     redistricting plan to the modeled electoral outcomes for \n     alternative plans that demonstrably comply with the \n     requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection \n     (b) in order to determine whether reasonable alternatives \n     exist that would result in materially lower levels of \n     partisan advantage or disadvantage on a statewide basis. For \n     purposes of this subparagraph, alternative plans considered \n     may include both actual plans proposed during the \n     redistricting process and other plans prepared for purposes \n     of comparison.\n       (D) Any other relevant information, including how broad \n     support for the redistricting plan was among members of the \n     entity responsible for developing and adopting the plan and \n     whether the processes leading to the development and adoption \n     of the plan were transparent and equally open to all members \n     of the entity and to the public.\n       (3) Rebuttable presumption.--\n       (A) Trigger.--In any civil action brought under section \n     5006 in which a party asserts a claim that a State has \n     enacted a redistricting plan which is in violation of this \n     subsection, a party may file a motion not later than 30 days \n     after the enactment of the plan (or, in the case of a plan \n     enacted before the effective date of this Act, not later than \n     30 days after the effective date of this Act) requesting that \n     the court determine whether a presumption of such a violation \n     exists. If such a motion is timely filed, the court shall \n     hold a hearing not later than 15 days after the date the \n     motion is filed to assess whether a presumption of such a \n     violation exists.\n       (B) Assessment.--To conduct the assessment required under \n     subparagraph (A), the court shall do the following:\n       (i) Determine the number of congressional districts under \n     the plan that would have been carried by each political \n     party's candidates for the office of President and the office \n     of Senator in the 2 most recent general elections for the \n     office of President and the 2 most recent general elections \n     for the office of Senator (other than special general \n     elections) immediately preceding the enactment of the plan, \n     except that if a State conducts a primary election for the \n     office of Senator which is open to candidates of all \n     political parties, the primary election shall be used instead \n     of the general election and the number of districts carried \n     by a party's candidates for the office of Senator shall be \n     determined on the basis of the combined vote share of all \n     candidates in the election who are affiliated with such \n     party.\n       (ii) Determine, for each of the 4 elections assessed under \n     clause (i), whether the number of districts that would have \n     been carried by any party's candidate as determined under \n     clause (i) results in partisan advantage or disadvantage in \n     excess of the applicable threshold described in subparagraph \n     (C). The degree of partisan advantage or disadvantage shall \n     be determined by one or more standard quantitative measures \n     of partisan fairness that--\n\n       (I) use a party's share of the statewide vote to calculate \n     a corresponding benchmark share of seats; and\n       (II) measure the amount by which the share of seats the \n     party's candidate would have won in the election involved \n     exceeds the benchmark share of seats.\n\n       (C) Applicable threshold described.--The applicable \n     threshold described in this subparagraph is, with respect to \n     a State and a number of seats, the greater of--\n       (i) an amount equal to 7 percent of the number of \n     congressional districts in the State; or\n       (ii) one congressional district.\n       (D) Description of quantitative measures; prohibiting \n     rounding.--In carrying out this subsection--\n       (i) the standard quantitative measures of partisan fairness \n     used by the court may include the simplified efficiency gap \n     but may not include strict proportionality; and\n       (ii) the court may not round any number.\n       (E) Presumption of violation.--A plan is presumed to \n     violate paragraph (1) if, on the basis of at least one \n     standard quantitative measure of partisan fairness, it \n     exceeds the applicable threshold described in subparagraph \n     (C) with respect to 2 or more of the 4 elections assessed \n     under subparagraph (B).\n       (F) Stay of use of plan.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this title, in any action under this paragraph, \n     the following rules shall apply:\n       (i) Upon filing of a motion under subparagraph (A), a \n     State's use of the plan which is the subject of the motion \n     shall be automatically stayed pending resolution of such \n     motion.\n       (ii) If after considering the motion, the court rules that \n     the plan is presumed under subparagraph (E) to violate \n     paragraph (1), a State may not use such plan until and unless \n     the court which is carrying out the determination of the \n     effect of the plan under paragraph (2) determines that, \n     notwithstanding the presumptive violation, the plan does not \n     violate paragraph (1).\n       (G) No effect on other assessments.--The absence of a \n     presumption of a violation with respect to a redistricting \n     plan as determined under this paragraph shall not affect the \n     determination of the effect or intent of the plan under this \n     section.\n       (4) Determination of intent.--A court may rely on all \n     available evidence when determining whether a redistricting \n     plan was drawn with the intent to materially favor or \n     disfavor a political party, including evidence of the \n     partisan effects of a plan, the degree of support the plan \n     received from members of the entity responsible for \n     developing and adopting the plan, and whether the processes \n     leading to development and adoption of the plan were \n     transparent and equally open to all members of the entity and \n     to the public.\n       (5) No violation based on certain criteria.--No \n     redistricting plan shall be found to be in violation of \n     paragraph (1) because of the proper application of the \n     criteria set forth in paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) of \n     subsection (b), unless one or more alternative plans could \n     have complied with such paragraphs without having the effect \n     of materially favoring or disfavoring a political party.\n       (d) Factors Prohibited From Consideration.--In developing \n     the redistricting plan for the State, the State may not take \n     into consideration any of the following factors, except as \n     necessary to comply with the criteria described in paragraphs \n     (1) through (3) of subsection (b), to achieve partisan \n     fairness and comply with subsection (b), and to enable the \n     redistricting plan to be measured against the external \n     metrics described in section 5004(c):\n       (1) The residence of any Member of the House of \n     Representatives or candidate.\n       (2) The political party affiliation or voting history of \n     the population of a district.\n       (e) Additional Criteria.--A State may not rely upon \n     criteria, districting principles, or other policies of the \n     State which are not set forth in this section to justify non-\n     compliance with the requirements of this section.\n       (f) Applicability.--\n       (1) In general.--This section applies to any authority, \n     whether appointed, elected, judicial, or otherwise, \n     responsible for enacting the congressional redistricting plan \n     of a State.\n       (2) Date of enactment.--This section applies to any \n     congressional redistricting plan enacted following the notice \n     of apportionment transmitted to the President on April 26, \n     2021, regardless of the date of enactment by the State of the \n     congressional redistricting plan.\n       (g) Severability of Criteria.--If any provision of this \n     section, or the application of any such provision to any \n     person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the \n     remainder of this section, and the application of such \n     provision to any other person or circumstance, shall not be \n     affected by the holding.\n\n     SEC. 5004. DEVELOPMENT OF PLAN.\n\n       (a) Public Notice and Input.--\n       (1) Use of open and transparent process.--The entity \n     responsible for developing and adopting the congressional \n     redistricting plan of a State shall solicit and take into \n     consideration comments from the public throughout the process \n     of developing the plan, and shall carry out its duties in an \n

districts.\n       (iv) A method by which members of the public may submit \n     comments directly to the entity.\n       (B) Searchable format.--The entity shall ensure that all \n     information posted and maintained on the site under this \n     paragraph, including information and proposed maps submitted \n     by the public, shall be maintained in an easily searchable \n     format.\n       (3) Multiple language requirements for all notices.--The \n     entity responsible for developing and adopting the plan shall \n     make each notice which is required to be posted and published \n     under this section available in any language in which the \n     State (or any jurisdiction in the State) is required to \n     provide election materials under section 203 of the Voting \n     Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10503).\n       (b) Development of Plan.--\n       (1) Hearings.--The entity responsible for developing and \n     adopting the congressional redistricting plan shall

1965, have a meaningful opportunity to attend and provide \n     input both before and after the entity releases proposed \n     plans.\n       (2) Posting of maps.--The entity responsible for developing \n     and adopting the congressional redistricting plan shall make \n     proposed plans, amendments to proposed plans,\n\n[[Page S4467]]\n\n     and the data needed to analyze such plans

and\n       (3) the final congressional redistricting plan developed \n     and published by the court under this section shall be deemed \n     to be enacted on the date on which the court publishes the \n     final congressional redistricting plan, as described in \n     subsection (e).\n       (c) Applicable Venue.--For purposes of this section, the \n     ``applicable venue'' with respect to a State is the District \n     of Columbia or the judicial district in which the capital of \n     the State is located, as selected by the first party to file \n     with the court sufficient evidence that a State has failed \n     to, or is reasonably likely to fail to, enact a final \n     redistricting plan for the State prior to the expiration of \n     the applicable deadline set forth in subsection (a).\n       (d) Procedures for Development of Plan.--\n       (1) Criteria.--In developing a redistricting plan for a \n     State under this section, the court shall adhere to the same \n     terms and conditions that applied (or that would have \n     applied, as the case may be) to the development of a plan by \n     the State under section 5003.\n       (2) Access to information and records.--The court shall \n     have access to any information, data, software, or other \n     records and material that was used (or that would have been \n     used, as the case may be) by the State in carrying out its \n     duties under this title.\n       (3) Hearing; public participation.--In developing a \n     redistricting plan for a State, the court shall--\n       (A) hold one or more evidentiary hearings at which \n     interested members of the public may appear and be heard and \n     present testimony, including expert testimony, in accordance \n     with the rules of the court;

A final decision by \n     the Court of Appeals may be reviewed by the Supreme Court of \n     the United States by writ of certiorari.\n       (b) Expedited Consideration.--In any action brought under \n     this section, it shall be the duty of the district court, the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n     Circuit, and the Supreme Court of the United States (if it \n     chooses to hear the action) to advance on the docket and to \n     expedite to the greatest possible extent the disposition of \n     the action and appeal.\n       (c) Remedies.--\n       (1) Adoption of replacement plan.--\n       (A) In general.--If the district court in an action under \n     this section finds that the congressional redistricting plan \n     of a State violates, in whole or in part, the requirements of \n     this title--\n       (i) the court shall adopt a replacement congressional \n     redistricting plan for the State in accordance with the \n     process set forth in section 5005; or\n       (ii) if circumstances warrant and no delay to an upcoming \n     regularly scheduled election for the House of Representatives \n     in the State would result, the district court, in its \n     discretion, may allow a State to develop and propose a \n     remedial congressional redistricting plan for review by the \n     court to determine whether the plan is in compliance with \n     this title, except that--\n\n       (I) the State may not develop and propose a remedial plan \n     under this clause if the court determines that the \n     congressional redistricting plan of the State was enacted \n     with discriminatory intent in violation of the Constitution \n     or section 5003(b); and\n       (II) nothing in this clause may be construed to permit a \n     State to use such a remedial plan which has not been approved \n     by the court.\n\n       (B) Prohibiting use of plans in violation of \n     requirements.--No court shall order a State to use a \n     congressional redistricting plan which violates, in whole or \n     in part, the requirements of this title, or to conduct an \n     election under terms and conditions which violate, in whole \n     or in part, the requirements of this title.\n       (C) Special rule in case final adjudication not expected \n     within 3 months of election.--\n       (i) Duty of court.--If final adjudication of an action \n     under this section is not reasonably expected to be completed \n     at least 3 months prior to the next regularly scheduled \n     primary election for the House of Representatives in the \n     State, the district court shall--\n\n       (I) develop, adopt, and order the use of an interim \n     congressional redistricting plan in accordance with section \n     5005(f) to address any claims under this title for which a \n     party seeking relief has demonstrated a substantial \n     likelihood of success; or\n       (II) order adjustments to the timing of primary elections \n     for the House of Representatives and other related deadlines, \n     as needed, to allow sufficient opportunity for adjudication \n     of the matter and adoption of a remedial or replacement plan \n     for use in the next regularly scheduled general elections for \n     the House of Representatives.\n\n       (ii) Prohibiting failure to act on grounds of pendency of \n     election.--The court may not refuse to take any action \n     described in clause (i) on the grounds of the pendency of the \n     next election held in the State or the potential for \n     disruption, confusion, or additional burdens with respect to \n     the administration of the election in the State.\n       (2) No stay pending appeal.--Notwithstanding the appeal of \n     an order finding that a congressional redistricting plan of a \n     State violates, in whole or in part, the requirements of this \n     title, no stay shall issue which shall bar the development or \n     adoption of a replacement or remedial plan under this \n     subsection, as may be directed by the district court, pending \n     such appeal. If such a replacement or remedial plan has been \n     adopted, no appellate court may stay or otherwise enjoin the \n     use of such plan during the pendency of an appeal, except \n     upon an order holding, based on the record, that adoption of \n     such plan was an abuse of discretion.\n       (3) Special authority of court of appeals.--\n       (A) Ordering of new remedial plan.--If, upon consideration \n     of an appeal under this title, the Court of Appeals \n     determines that a plan does not comply with the requirements \n     of this title, it shall direct that the District Court \n     promptly develop a new remedial plan with assistance of a \n     special master for consideration by the Court of Appeals.\n       (B) Failure of district court to take timely action.--If, \n     at any point during the pendency of an action under this \n     section, the District Court fails to take action necessary to \n     permit resolution of the case prior to the next regularly \n     scheduled election for the House of Representatives in the \n     State or fails to grant the relief described in paragraph \n     (1)(C), any party may seek a writ of mandamus from the Court \n     of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Court of \n     Appeals shall have jurisdiction over the motion for a writ of \n     mandamus and shall establish an expedited briefing and \n     hearing schedule for resolution of the motion. If the Court \n     of Appeals determines that a writ should be granted, the \n     Court of Appeals shall take any action necessary, including \n     developing a congressional redistricting plan with assistance \n     of a special master to ensure that a remedial plan is adopted \n     in time for use in the next regularly scheduled election for \n     the House of Representatives in the State.\n       (4) Effect of enactment of replacement plan.--A State's \n     enactment of a redistricting plan which replaces a plan which \n     is the subject of an action under this section shall not be \n     construed to limit or otherwise affect the authority of the \n     court to adjudicate or grant relief with respect to any \n     claims or issues not addressed by the replacement plan, \n     including claims that the plan which is the subject of the \n     action was enacted, in whole or in part, with discriminatory \n     intent, or claims to consider whether relief should be \n     granted under section 3(c) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 \n     (52 U.S.C. 10302(c)) based on the plan which is the subject \n     of the action.\n       (d) Attorney's Fees.--In a civil action under this section, \n     the court may allow the prevailing party (other than the \n     United States) reasonable attorney fees, including litigation \n     expenses, and costs.\n       (e) Relation to Other Laws.--\n       (1) Rights and remedies additional to other rights and \n     remedies.--The rights and remedies established by this \n     section are in addition to all other rights and remedies \n     provided by law, and neither the rights and remedies \n     established by this section nor any other provision of this \n     title shall supersede, restrict, or limit the application of \n     the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.).\n       (2) Voting rights act of 1965.--Nothing in this title \n     authorizes or requires conduct that is prohibited by the \n     Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.).\n       (f) Legislative Privilege.--No person, legislature, or \n     State may claim legislative privilege under either State or \n     Federal law in a civil action brought under this section or \n     in any other legal challenge, under either State or Federal \n     law, to a redistricting plan enacted under this title.\n       (g) Removal.--\n       (1) In general.--At any time, a civil action brought in a \n     State court which asserts a claim for which the district \n     courts of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction under \n     this title may be removed by any party in the case, including \n     an intervenor, by filing, in the district court for an \n     applicable venue under this section, a notice of removal \n     signed pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n     Procedure containing a short and plain statement of the \n     grounds for removal. Consent of parties shall not be required \n     for removal.\n       (2) Claims not within the original or supplemental \n     jurisdiction.--If a civil action removed in accordance with \n     paragraph (1) contains claims not within the original or \n     supplemental jurisdiction of the district court, the district \n     court shall sever all such claims and remand them to the \n     State court from which the action was removed.\n\n     SEC. 5007. NO EFFECT ON ELECTIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL OFFICE.\n\n       Nothing in this title or in any amendment made by this \n     title may be construed to affect the manner in which a State \n     carries out elections for State or local office, including \n     the process by which a State establishes the districts used \n     in such elections.\n\n     SEC. 5008. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--This title and the amendments made by this \n     title shall apply on the date of enactment of this title.\n       (b) Application to Congressional Redistricting Plans \n     Resulting From 2020 Decennial Census.--Notwithstanding \n     subsection (a), this title and the amendments made by this \n     title, other than section 5004, shall apply with respect to \n     each congressional redistricting plan enacted pursuant to the \n     notice of apportionment transmitted to the President on April \n     26, 2021, without regard to whether or not a State enacted \n     such a plan prior to the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n                TITLE VI--CAMPAIGN FINANCE TRANSPARENCY\n\n                        Subtitle A--DISCLOSE Act\n\n     SEC. 6001. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Democracy Is \n     Strengthened by Casting Light On Spending in Elections Act of \n     2024'' or the ``DISCLOSE Act of 2024''.\n\n     SEC. 6002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Campaign finance disclosure is a narrowly tailored and \n     minimally restrictive means to advance substantial government \n     interests, including fostering an informed electorate capable \n     of engaging in self-government and holding their elected \n     officials accountable, detecting and deterring quid pro quo \n     corruption, and identifying information necessary to enforce \n     other campaign finance laws, including campaign contribution \n     limits and the prohibition on foreign money in U.S. \n     campaigns. To further these substantial interests, campaign \n     finance disclosure must be timely and complete, and must \n     disclose the true and original source of money given, \n     transferred, and spent to influence Federal elections. \n     Current law does not meet this objective because corporations \n     and other entities that the Supreme Court has permitted to \n     spend money to influence Federal elections are subject to few \n     if any transparency requirements.\n       (2) As the Supreme Court recognized in its per curiam \n     opinion in Buckley v.  Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, (1976), \n     ``disclosure requirements certainly in most applications \n     appear to be the least restrictive means of curbing the evils \n     of campaign ignorance and corruption that Congress found to \n     exist.'' Buckley, 424 U.S. at 68. In Citizens United v. FEC, \n     the Court reiterated that ``disclosure is a less restrictive\n\n[[Page S4469]]\n\n     alternative to more comprehensive regulations of speech.'' \n     558 U.S. 310, 369 (2010).\n       (3) No subsequent decision has called these holdings into \n     question, including the Court's decision in Americans for \n     Prosperity Foundation v. Bonta, 141 S. Ct. 2373 (2021). That \n     case did not involve campaign finance disclosure, and the \n     Court did not overturn its longstanding recognition of the \n     substantial interests furthered by such disclosure.\n       (4) Campaign finance disclosure is also essential to \n     enforce the Federal Election Campaign Act's prohibition on \n     contributions by and solicitations of foreign nationals. See \n     section 319 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (52 \n     U.S.C. 30121).\n       (5) Congress should close loopholes allowing spending by \n     foreign nationals in domestic elections. For example, in \n     2021, the Federal Election Commission, the independent \n     Federal agency charged with protecting the integrity of the \n     Federal campaign finance process, found reason to believe and \n     conciliated a matter where an experienced political \n     consultant knowingly and willfully violated Federal law by \n     soliciting a contribution from a foreign national by offering \n     to transmit a $2,000,000 contribution to a super PAC through \n     his company and two 501(c)(4) organizations, to conceal the \n     origin of the funds. This scheme was only unveiled after \n     appearing in a The Telegraph UK article and video capturing \n     the solicitation. See Conciliation Agreement, MURs 7165 & \n     7196 (Great America PAC, et al.), date June 28, 2021; Factual \n     and Legal Analysis, MURs 7165 & 7196 (Jesse Benton), dated \n     Mar. 2, 2021.\n\n  PART 1--CLOSING LOOPHOLES ALLOWING SPENDING BY FOREIGN NATIONALS IN \n                               ELECTIONS\n\n     SEC. 6003.

REPORTING OF FEDERAL JUDICIAL NOMINATION \n                   DISBURSEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A fair and impartial judiciary is critical for our \n     democracy and crucial to maintain the faith of the people of \n     the United States in the justice system. As the Supreme Court \n     held in Caperton v. Massey, ``there is a serious risk of \n     actual bias--based on objective and reasonable perceptions--\n     when a person with a personal stake in a particular case had \n     a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the \n     judge on the case.'' ( Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 \n     U.S. 868, 884 (2009)).\n       (2) Public trust in government is at a historic low. \n     According to polling, most Americans believe that \n     corporations have too much power and influence in politics \n     and the courts.\n       (3) The prevalence and pervasiveness of dark money drives \n     public concern about corruption in politics and the courts. \n     Dark money is funding for organizations and political \n     activities that cannot be traced to actual donors. It is made \n     possible by loopholes in our tax laws and regulations, weak \n     oversight by the Internal Revenue Service, and donor-friendly \n     court decisions.\n       (4) Under current law, ``social welfare'' organizations and \n     business leagues can use funds to influence elections so long \n     as political activity is not their ``primary'' activity. \n     Super PACs can accept and spend unlimited contributions from \n     any non-foreign source. These groups can spend tens of \n     millions of dollars on political activities. Such dark\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\n     money groups spent an estimated $1,050,000,000 in the 2020 \n     election cycle.\n       (5) Dark money is used to shape judicial decision-making. \n     This can take many forms, akin to agency capture: influencing \n     judicial selection by controlling who gets nominated and \n     funding candidate advertisements; creating public relations \n     campaigns aimed at mobilizing the judiciary around particular \n     issues; and drafting law review articles, amicus briefs, and \n     other products which tell judges how to decide a given case \n     and provide ready-made arguments for willing judges to adopt.\n       (6) Over the past decade, nonprofit organizations that do \n     not disclose their donors have spent hundreds of millions of \n     dollars to influence the nomination and confirmation process \n     for Federal judges. One organization alone has spent nearly \n     $40,000,000 on advertisements supporting or opposing Supreme \n     Court nominees since 2016.\n       (7) Anonymous money spent on judicial nominations is not \n     subject to any disclosure requirements.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Honest Ads Act''.\n\n     SEC. 6102. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this subtitle is to enhance the integrity of \n     American democracy and national security by improving \n     disclosure requirements for online political advertisements \n     in order to uphold the Supreme Court's well-established \n     standard that the electorate bears the right to be fully \n     informed.\n\n     SEC. 6103. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 2002, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 \n     (Public Law 107-155) became law, establishing disclosure \n     requirements for political advertisements distributed from a \n     television or radio broadcast station or provider of cable or \n     satellite television. In 2003, the Supreme Court upheld \n     regulations on electioneering communications established \n     under the Act, noting that such requirements ``provide the \n     electorate with information and insure that the voters are \n     fully informed about the person or group who is speaking.'' \n     The Court reaffirmed this conclusion in 2010 by an 8-1 vote.\n       (2) In its 2006 rulemaking, the Federal Election \n     Commission, the independent Federal agency charged with \n     protecting the integrity of the Federal campaign finance \n     process, noted that 18 percent of all Americans cited the \n     internet as their leading source of news about the 2004 \n     Presidential election. By contrast, Gallup and the Knight \n     Foundation found in 2020 that the majority of Americans, 58 \n     percent, got most of their news about elections online.\n       (3) According to studies from AdImpact and Borrell \n     Associates, in 2020, an estimated $1,700,000,000 was spent on \n     online political advertising, more than 10 times the amount \n     spent in 2012.\n       (4) In order to enhance transparency of all political \n     advertisement funding, it is prudent to extend to online \n     internet platforms the same types of political advertisement \n     disclosure requirements applicable to broadcast television \n     and radio stations, and providers of cable and satellite \n     television.\n       (5) Effective and complete transparency for voters must \n     include information about the true and original source of \n     money given, transferred, and spent on political \n     advertisements made online.\n       (6) Requiring the disclosure of this information is a \n     necessary and narrowly tailored means to inform the voting \n     public of who is behind digital advertising disseminated to \n     influence their votes and to enable the Federal Election \n     Commission and the Department of Justice to detect and \n     prosecute illegal foreign spending on local, State, and \n     Federal elections and other campaign finance violations.\n       (7) Paid advertising on large online platforms is different \n     from advertising placed on other common media in terms of the \n     comparatively low cost of reaching large numbers of people, \n     the availability of sophisticated microtargeting, and the \n     ease with which online advertisers, particularly those \n     located outside the United States, can evade disclosure \n     requirements. Requiring large online platforms to maintain \n     public files of information about the online political ads \n     they disseminate is the best and least restrictive means to \n     ensure the voting public has complete information about who \n     is trying to influence their votes and to aid enforcement of \n     other laws, including the prohibition on foreign money in \n     domestic campaigns.\n       (8) The reach of a few large internet platforms--larger \n     than any broadcast, satellite, or cable provider--has greatly \n     facilitated the scope and effectiveness of disinformation \n     campaigns. For instance, the largest platform has over \n     247,000,000 American users--over 153,000,000 of them on a \n     daily basis. By contrast, the largest cable television \n     provider has 16,142,000 subscribers, while the largest \n     satellite television provider has 13,300,000 subscribers. And \n     the most-watched television broadcast in United States \n     history had 118,000,000 viewers.\n       (9) The public nature of broadcast television, radio, and \n     satellite ensures a level of publicity for any political \n     advertisement. These communications are accessible to the \n     press, fact-checkers, and political opponents. This creates \n     strong disincentives for a candidate to disseminate \n     materially false, inflammatory, or contradictory messages to \n     the public. Social media platforms, in contrast, can target \n     portions of the electorate with direct, ephemeral \n     advertisements often on the basis of private information the \n     platform has on individuals, enabling political \n     advertisements that are contradictory, racially or socially \n     inflammatory, or materially false.\n       (10) Large social media platforms are the only entities in \n     possession of certain key data related to paid online ads, \n     including the exact audience targeted by those ads and their \n     number of impressions. Such information, which cannot be \n     reliably disclosed by the purchasers of ads, is extremely \n     useful for informing the electorate, guarding against \n     corruption, and aiding in the enforcement of existing \n     campaign finance regulations.\n       (11) Paid advertisements on social media platforms have \n     served as critical tools for foreign online influence \n     campaigns--even those that rely on large amounts of unpaid \n     content--because such ads allow foreign actors to test the \n     effectiveness of different messages, expose their messages to \n     audiences who have not sought out such content, and recruit \n     audiences for future campaigns and posts.\n       (12) A 2019 Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's \n     Report on Russian Active Measures Campaigns and Interference \n     in the 2016 U.S. Election Volume 2: Russia's Use of Social \n     Media with Additional Views, the Committee recommended ``that \n     Congress examine legislative approaches to ensuring Americans \n     know the sources of online political advertisements. The \n     Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 requires political \n     advertisements on television, radio and satellite to disclose \n     the sponsor of the advertisement. The same requirements \n     should apply online. This will also help to ensure that the \n     IRA or any similarly situated actors cannot use paid \n     advertisements for purposes of foreign interference.''.\n       (13) On March 16, 2021, the Office of the Director of \n     National Intelligence released the declassified Intelligence \n     Community assessment of foreign threats to the 2020 U.S. \n     Federal elections. The declassified report found: \n     ``Throughout the election cycle, Russia's online influence \n     actors sought to affect U.S. public perceptions of the \n     candidates, as well as advance Moscow's longstanding goals of \n     undermining confidence in US election processes and \n     increasing sociopolitical divisions among the American \n     people.'' The report also determined that Iran sought to \n     influence the election by ``creating and amplifying social \n     media content that criticized [candidates].''\n       (14) According to a Wall Street Journal report in April \n     2021, voluntary ad libraries operated by major platforms rely \n     on foreign governments to self-report political ad purchases. \n     These ad-buys, including those diminishing major human rights \n     violations like the Uighur genocide, are under-reported by \n     foreign government purchasers, with no substantial oversight \n     or repercussions from the platforms.\n       (15) Multiple reports have indicated that online ads have \n     become a key vector for strategic influence by the People's \n     Republic of China. An April 2021 Wall Street Journal report \n     noted that the Chinese government and Chinese state-owned \n     enterprises are major purchasers of ads on the U.S.'s largest \n     social media platform, including to advance Chinese \n     propaganda.\n       (16) Large online platforms have made changes to their \n     policies intended to make it harder for foreign actors to \n     purchase political ads. However, these private actions have \n     not been taken by all platforms, have not been reliably \n     enforced, and are subject to immediate change at the \n     discretion of the platforms.\n       (17) The Federal Election Commission's current regulations \n     on political advertisements do not provide sufficient \n     transparency to uphold the public's right to be fully \n     informed about political advertisements made online.\n\n     SEC. 6104. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the dramatic increase in digital political \n     advertisements, and the growing centrality of online \n     platforms in the lives of Americans, requires the Congress \n     and the Federal Election Commission to take meaningful action \n     to ensure that laws and regulations provide the \n     accountability and transparency that is fundamental to our \n     democracy;\n       (2) free and fair elections require both transparency and \n     accountability which give the public a right to know the true \n     sources of funding for political advertisements, be they \n     foreign or domestic, in order to make informed political \n     choices and hold elected officials accountable; and\n       (3) transparency of funding for political advertisements is \n     essential to enforce other campaign finance laws, including \n     the prohibition on campaign spending by foreign nationals.\n\n     SEC. 6105.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the ``Help \n     America Run Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Everyday Americans experience barriers to entry before \n     they can consider running for office to serve their \n     communities.\n       (2) Current law states that campaign funds cannot be spent \n     on everyday expenses that would exist whether or not a \n     candidate were running for office, like childcare and food. \n     While the law seems neutral, its actual effect is to \n     privilege the independently wealthy who want to run, because \n     given the demands of running for office, candidates who must \n     work to pay for childcare or to afford health insurance are \n     effectively being left out of the process, even if they have \n     sufficient support to mount a viable campaign.\n       (3) Thus current practice favors those prospective \n     candidates who do not need to rely on a regular paycheck to \n     make ends meet. The consequence is that everyday Americans \n     who have firsthand knowledge of the importance of stable \n     childcare, a safety net, or great public schools are less \n     likely to get a seat at the table. This governance by the few \n     is antithetical to the democratic experiment, but most \n     importantly, when lawmakers do not share the concerns of \n     everyday Americans, their policies reflect that.\n       (4) These circumstances have contributed to a Congress that \n     does not always reflect everyday Americans. The New York \n     Times reported in 2019 that fewer than 5 percent of \n     representatives cite blue-collar or service jobs in their \n     biographies. A 2020 analysis by OpenSecrets of lawmakers' \n     personal financial disclosure statements showed that the \n     median net worth of lawmakers was just over $1,000,000, or \n     nearly 9 times the median net worth of American families.\n\n[[Page S4488]]\n\n       (5) These circumstances have also contributed to a \n     governing body that does not reflect the nation it serves. \n     For instance, women are 51 percent of the American \n     population. Yet even with a record number of women serving in \n     the One Hundred Eighteenth Congress, the Pew Research Center \n     notes that nearly three out of four Members of this Congress \n     are male. The Center for American Women and Politics found \n     that one third of women legislators surveyed had been \n     actively discouraged from running for office, often by \n     political professionals. This type of discouragement, \n     combined with the prohibitions on using campaign funds for \n     domestic needs like childcare, burdens that still fall \n     disproportionately on American women, particularly \n     disadvantages working mothers. These barriers may explain why \n     only 10 women in history have given birth while serving in \n     Congress, in spite of the prevalence of working parents in \n     other professions. Yet working mothers and fathers are best \n     positioned to create policy that reflects the lived \n     experience of most Americans.\n       (6) Working mothers, those caring for their elderly \n     parents, and young professionals who rely on their jobs for \n     health insurance should have the freedom to run to serve the \n     people of the United States. Their networks and net worth are \n     simply not the best indicators of their strength as \n     prospective public servants. In fact, helping ordinary \n     Americans to run may create better policy for all Americans.\n       (c) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to ensure \n     that all Americans who are otherwise qualified to serve this \n     Nation are able to run for office, regardless of their \n     economic status. By expanding permissible uses of campaign \n     funds and providing modest assurance that testing a run for \n     office will not cost one's livelihood, the Help America Run \n     Act will facilitate the candidacy of representatives who more \n     accurately reflect the experiences, challenges, and ideals of \n     everyday Americans.\n\n     SEC. 8202.
