AUTHORIZATION OF AWARD OF MEDAL OF HONOR TO JOSEPH M. PEREZ \n                    FOR ACTS OF VALOR AS A MEMBER OF THE ARMY DURING \n                    THE VIETNAM WAR.\n\n  (a) Recognition of Acts of Valor.--Congress recognizes the \nfollowing acts of valor by Joseph M. Perez:\n          (1) Joseph M. Perez distinguished himself by valorous \n        actions against overwhelming odds while serving as a \n        Sergeant in the Army, with Company C, 3rd Battalion, \n        8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, in South \n        Vietnam.\n          (2) On May 26, 1967, during the Vietnam War, Sergeant \n        Perez acted as the fire team leader with the Commanding \n        Officer of Company C and led an infantry unit \n        conducting a search and destroy task near the Cambodian \n        border. When the unit reached the top of a hill, they \n        were suddenly under attack from a concealed sniper.\n          (3) During the initial phase of battle, Sergeant \n        Perez and the unit took cover to assess and decide the \n        strength of the enemy and determine the direction of \n        where the attack was coming from. When the enemy \n        launched a hand-grenade, the fire team returned fire. \n        Without hesitation or concern for his personal safety, \n        Sergeant Perez absorbed the full lethal explosion of \n        the grenade and shielded his fellow soldiers from the \n        blast. The explosion caused Sergeant Perez to lose his \n        right eye and severed his right hand.\n          (4) The fire team moved to relocate to a safer area, \n        leaving Sergeant Perez alone. Once Sergeant Perez \n        regained consciousness, he crawled twenty meters to \n        safe ground to be treated by medics.\n          (5) Sergeant Perez's personal leadership in intense \n        close combat resulted in a major win for his battalion \n        against overwhelming odds, though he lost his eye and \n        hand and nearly lost his life, he saved the lives of \n        three of his fire team members from death and serious \n        injuries from the explosion.\n          (6) Sergeant Perez's selfless devotion to duty, his \n        extraordinary heroism, conspicuous gallantry and \n        intrepidity, and numerous risks of his life above and \n        beyond the call of duty are all in keeping with the \n        highest traditions of the Army, and reflect great \n        credit on himself, the Armed Forces, and the United \n        States.\n  (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n          (1) When awarding him the distinguished-service \n        cross, Sergeant Perez's chain of command was unaware of \n        the full extent of his valorous actions and the \n        numerous risks he took for his soldiers, all above and \n        beyond the call of duty.\n          (2) Although Sergeant Perez absorbed the lethal \n        explosion of a hand grenade, once he regained \n        consciousness, he continued to move with his battalion \n        against devastating and overwhelming enemy fire.\n  (c) Authorization.--Notwithstanding the time limitations \nspecified in section 7274 of title 10, United States Code, or \nany other time limitation with respect to the awarding of \ncertain medals to persons who served in the Armed Forces, the \nPresident is authorized to award the Medal of Honor, under \nsection 7271 of such title, to Joseph M. Perez for the acts of \nvalor described in subsection (d).\n  (d) Acts of Valor Described.--The acts of valor described in \nthis subsection are the actions of Joseph M. Perez on May 26, \n1967, while serving as a member of the Army during the Vietnam \nWar, for which he was previously awarded the distinguished-\nservice cross.\n                              ----------"

Carey for the acts of valor \ndescribed in subsection (b).\n  (b) Acts of Valor.--The acts of valor described in this \nsubsection are as follows:\n          (1) Lieutenant General Richard E. Carey participated \n        in the Inchon Landing, captured communist forces, and \n        led his rifle platoon to Seoul. Three months later, on \n        East Hill at the Chosin Reservoir, Carey hurled \n        grenades at Chinese forces. Carey and his fellow \n        Marines were outnumbered eight to one. They held their \n        ground and broke through the Chinese trap to the sea.\n          (2) Carey remained in the fight until March 1951. \n        While commanding a platoon of machine gunners, Carey \n        was badly wounded. He continued leading his troops and \n        initially refused to get aid for his injuries. Carey's \n        wounds required hospitalization. During 189 days in \n        Korea, Carey had seven near-death experiences. As a \n        result of his actions in Korea, Carey received the \n        Silver Star, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart.\n          (3) Returning to the United States, Carey earned a \n        flight training slot and became a fighter pilot. In the \n        early 1960s Carey scouted Marine airfield sites in \n        Vietnam. He returned to Vietnam in the summer of 1967 \n        and served during the Tet offensive. Carey flew 204 \n        combat sorties earning the Distinguished Flying Cross \n        and 16 Air Medals.\n                              ----------"

AUTHORIZATION FOR AWARD OF THE MEDAL OF HONOR TO THOMAS H. \n                    GRIFFIN FOR ACTS OF VALOR AS A MEMBER OF THE ARMY \n                    DURING THE VIETNAM WAR.\n\n  (a) Acts of Valor Described.--Congress recognizes the \nfollowing acts of valor by Thomas Helmut Griffin:\n          (1) Thomas Helmut Griffin distinguished himself by \n        valorous actions against overwhelming odds while \n        serving as a captain in the Army, Senior Advisor, 4/5 \n        Infantry Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division, Army of the \n        Republic of Vietnam.\n          (2) From March 1, 1969 through March 3, 1969, during \n        the Vietnam War, such battalion was ordered to \n        forestall an imminent attack on Quang Ngai City \n        threatened by units of the North Vietnamese Army \n        (hereinafter, ``NVA''). The 4/5 Battalion engaged \n        unabatedly with an entrenched NVA regiment over the \n        course of three days. Captain Griffin (hereinafter, \n        ``CPT Griffin'') risked his life and disregarded his \n        personal safety, all above and beyond his duty, on some \n        20 occasions, to lead his battalion in the fight as \n        well as direct gunships, air, and artillery strikes on \n        the enemy positions.\n          (3) During the initial phase of battle, CPT Griffin \n        made numerous trips across 50 meters of open ground, \n        while under heavy automatic weapon, rocket, and small \n        arms fire, to advise on the conduct of the battle and \n        better direct strikes against enemy forces. Fearing \n        slaughter of his soldiers, CPT Griffin, with one of his \n        counterparts from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam \n        (hereinafter, ``ARVN''), charged directly into heavy \n        enemy fire and assaulted a machine gun bunker. CPT \n        Griffin continued these runs, despite the enemy \n        shooting the heels off CPT Griffin's boots.\n          (4) After taking out the NVA bunker, CPT Griffin \n        brandished the captured machine gun and rocket launcher \n        to exhort his battalion out of the kill zone and \n        continue the assault into the enemy entrenchments while \n        remaining exposed to heavy fire. CPT Griffin's raw and \n        intense close combat leadership galvanized his \n        battalion to move out of the kill zone and continue \n        their mission.\n          (5) CPT Griffin's ARVN counterpart was struck by \n        close fire, and CPT Griffin unhesitatingly carried the \n        wounded commander to safety while shielding him with \n        his own body against rocket and artillery fire. CPT \n        Griffin proceeded to carry four more wounded soldiers \n        to safety while protecting them with his own body, \n        returning each time against devastating enemy fire. \n        While leading the final attack, CPT Griffin was hit \n        three times in the chest by enemy small arms fire, yet \n        continued to lead at the forefront of his battalion \n        until the mission was completed. Under CPT Griffin's \n        command and leadership, the 4/5 Battalion continued to \n        reduce the enemy regiment's fighting capacity.\n          (6) CPT Griffin's personal leadership in intense \n        close combat resulted in a major win for his battalion \n        against overwhelming odds, killing 93 enemy soldiers \n        and saving the lives of over 300 allied soldiers by \n        galvanizing and leading them out of the kill zone.\n          (7) CPT Griffin's selfless devotion to duty, his \n        extraordinary heroism, conspicuous gallantry and \n        intrepidity, and numerous risks of his life above and \n        beyond the call of duty, are all in keeping with the \n        highest traditions of the Army, and reflect great \n        credit on himself, the Armed Forces, and the United \n        States.\n  (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following with regards to \nthe original decision to award a Silver Star to Thomas Helmut \nGriffin:\n          (1) When awarding him the Silver Star, CPT Griffin's \n        chain of command was unaware of the full extent of his \n        valorous actions and the numerous risks he took for his \n        soldiers, all above and beyond the call of duty.\n          (2) Congress notes that although CPT Griffin was \n        struck three times by enemy fire, and at one point was \n        completely surrounded by the enemy, he continued to \n        fight and lead his battalion against devastating and \n        overwhelming enemy fire.\n          (3) Congress notes that CPT Griffin's Commanding \n        Officer, Colonel Dean E. Hutter (ret.), sent a letter \n        to the Department of the Army dated November 6, 2013, \n        in which he accounts for the revelation of additional, \n        substantive and material evidence not known at the time \n        of the decision to award the Silver Star, and in which \n        he describes as compelling ``the justice of upgrading \n        CPT Griffin's sustained and varied acts of combat valor \n        to their rightful level of recognition, the Medal of \n        Honor''.\n          (4) Congress further notes that Colonel Hutter issued \n        a letter to former United States Representative Sam \n        Farr on September 15, 2011, noting his support for an \n        upgrade from a Silver Star to a Medal of Honor, having \n        recognized CPT Griffin's acts of valor as, ``numerous, \n        selfless demonstrations of personal risk in pressing a \n        close-combat attack against a well-entrenched element \n        of a battalion-size enemy formation''.\n  (c) Authorization of Award of Medal of Honor to Thomas Helmut \nGriffin for Acts of Valor as a Member of the Army During the \nVietnam War.--\n          (1) Authorization.--Notwithstanding the time \n        limitations specified in section 7274 of title 10, \n        United States Code, or any other time limitation with \n        respect to the awarding of certain medals to persons \n        who served in the Armed Forces, the President is \n        authorized to award the Medal of Honor, under section \n        7271 of such title, to Thomas Helmut Griffin for the \n        acts of valor described in subsection (b).\n          (2) Acts of valor described.--The acts of valor \n        described in this subsection are the actions of Thomas \n        H. Griffin during the period of March 1 through March \n        3, 1969, while serving as a captain in the Army during \n        the Vietnam War, for which he was previously awarded \n        the Silver Star.\n                              ----------"
